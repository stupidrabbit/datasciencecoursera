## Description
This is a 3D scatterplot build with plotly for Iris dataset. Values of petal length, petal width and sepal length of iris flowers are shown on separate axes while color codes the species.
  
You can rotate a plot around its axes.

```{r}
require (plotly)
require (dplyr)
data (iris)
```
***
```{r}
fig <- plot_ly(data = iris, x = ~Petal.Length, y = ~Petal.Width, z = ~Sepal.Length, type = "scatter3d", color = ~Species, mode = "markers") %>% layout (title = 'Iris plot')
fig
```
